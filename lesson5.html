                    <h1 class="content-header-bl" style="margin-top: 15px;">What is Troubleshooting?</h1>
                    <p class="content-body-bl">
                        Troubleshooting is a systematic approach to problem-solving that is often used to find and correct issues with complex machines, electronics, computers and software systems. The first step in most troubleshooting methods is 
                        gathering information on the issue, such as an undesired behavior or a lack of expected functionality.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-body-bl">
                        Once the issue and how to reproduce it are understood, the next step is to eliminate unnecessary components to determine if the issue persists. This can help identify component incompatibility issues and problems caused by third-party products.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-body-bl">
                        Troubleshooting methodologies usually try to isolate a problem so that it can be examined. The initial goal is to diagnose the problem and try obvious solutions, such as performing a system reboot, powering down and up, and checking that the power cord is connected. <br><br>
                        Troubleshooters initially look for common, known causes. For example, when a laptop won't boot up, an obvious first step is to check whether the power cable is working. Once common issues are ruled out, troubleshooters must run through a checklist of components to identify where the failure is happening.<br><br>
                        The primary objectives of troubleshooting are to figure out why something doesn't work as intended and provide a solution to resolve the issue.
                    </p>
                    <h1 class="content-header-bl" style="margin-top: 15px;">How does Troubleshooting work?</h1>
                    <p class="content-body-bl">
                        Computer problems that troubleshooters address can show up in any number of places. Examples of places troubleshooters find themselves working include the following:
                        <ul class="content-body-bl">
                            <li>●	Operating Systems</li>
                            <li>●   Applications</li>
                            <li>●   Central Processing Unit or CPUs</li>
                            <li>●   Firewalls</li>
                            <li>●   Hard Drives</li>
                            <li>●   Solid-State Drives</li>
                            <li>●   Servers</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-body-bl">
                        One basic troubleshooting method is to press Control-Alt-Delete on a PC, which opens the Microsoft Windows Task Manager where users can determine which applications have become unresponsive, close them and restart the computer. Similarly, Option-Command-Escape will force quit apps on a Mac.<br><br>
                        IT and help desk professionals use more extensive ways to troubleshoot problems. Troubleshooting methodologies vary, but the following seven steps are often used.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-body-bl">
                        <strong>Step 1. Gather Information</strong><br><br>
                        The first troubleshooting step for just about any problem is gathering information about it. This can be information about why something unexpected is happening or a missing capability. <br><br>
                        Other important information includes related symptoms and unique circumstances that must happen to reproduce the issue. The goal is to identify the problem and understand how to reproduce it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-body-bl">
                        <strong>Step 2. Describe the Problem</strong><br><br>
                        By comprehensively describing the issue, troubleshooters will know where to look for the root cause. It can help to ask the following questions: <br><br>
                        <ul class="content-body-bl">
                            <li>●	What are the symptoms?</li>
                            <li>●	When does the problem occur?</li>
                            <li>●	Where does the problem occur?</li>
                            <li>●	What are the conditions when the problem occurs?</li>
                            <li>●	Is the problem reproducible?</li>
                        </ul><br>
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-body-bl">
                        Answers to these questions will expose which components aren't part of the problem. They will also help identify possible compatibility issues among components and third-party products that might cause issues. <br><br>
                        If the issue remains, a specialist might check other common causes, consult product documentation, and conduct research on a support database or through a search engine.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-body-bl">
                        <strong>Step 3. Determine the most probable cause</strong><br><br>
                        Sometimes a problem can have many possible causes. A trial-and-error method is used to eliminate various options. The best approach is to look for the most straightforward cause first, even when working with a complex system. <br><br>
                        One common testing method is the split-half troubleshooting approach. This technique isolates the source of a problem through a process of 
                        elimination. This method works best when the system involved has a number of parts in series. Troubleshooters first test halfway down the 
                        line of components. If the middle component works, they know everything before it works. At this point, they move on to the middle of the 
                        remaining untested section toward the end of the series. If the test of this second section works, they go on to the midpoint of the remaining section. <br><br>
                        If the problem occurs at any point in this testing, then the troubleshooters do a split back toward the start of the series until the problem part is found. The split-half process can save time in systems that depend on many components.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-body-bl">
                        <strong>Step 4. Create a plan of action and test a solution</strong><br><br>
                        Once the problem is understood, troubleshooters develop a plan to tackle the issue. They test their hypothesis and keep testing it until they identify a solution. When all tests fail, go back to Step 3 and start over.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-body-bl">
                        <strong>Step 5. Implement the solution</strong><br><br>
                        Once troubleshooters have identified and understood the problem, they must adjust, repair or replace whatever is causing the issue. When that is done, they should test the solution to be sure the problem is fixed. <br><br>
                        The goal is to return the system to the way it was before the problem occurred. Successful troubleshooting is indicated when the problem is no longer reproducible and functionality is restored. The success of the troubleshooting process often depends on the technicians' thoroughness and experience.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-body-bl">
                        <strong>Step 6. Analyze the results</strong><br><br>
                        Sometimes the solution to a problem creates another issue. Troubleshooters must monitor the system to ensure the changes made don't adversely affect other parts of it or other systems connected to it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-body-bl">
                        <strong>Step 7. Document the process</strong><br><br>
                        The final step is to document all steps taken. This ensures other troubleshooters will know what to do if the problem happens again. It's critical to document both the solution and the fixes that didn't work to provide a comprehensive record of the incident. Documentation will also help in creating troubleshooting checklists to quickly identify and fix potential problems.

                                <li>●	Documentation should be part of your definition of done. For example, you shouldn’t be able to test a feature until it has the appropriate documentation. Test documentation is a vital part of that process, and receiving the correct documentation from the developers, such as a software requirements spec, is critical for effective testing. </li>
                                <li>●	Test documentation eliminates much of the confusion and anxiety involved in the testing phase of your software product when your entire testing team has access to the appropriate documents. Testing teams understand what needs to be tested and have access to detailed plans of how the testing is intended to be executed.</li>
                                <li>●	Test documentation saves time by clearly articulating the tasks that need to be completed by engineers, analysts, and so on. It prevents testing taking up more resources than it needs, and testers spend less time rehashing topics that have already been decided, improving overall test efficiency. </li>
                                <li>●	You have a record of the changes that have been made to your software and any bugs that have resulted. </li>

                    <h1 class="content-header-bl" style="margin-top: 15px; font-size: 30px">COMMON DOCUMENTATION ARTIFACTS</h1>
                    <p class="content-body-bl">The most frequently used artifacts used in test documentation are as follows: </p>
                    <h1 class="content-header-bl" style="margin-top: 15px;">Test Case</h1>
                    <p class="content-body-bl">A test case is a detailed description of the exact steps a tester needs to go through to evaluate the functionality of a particular feature, including the criteria for passing the test. Test cases result in standardization for different testers conducting the same software test. </p>
                    <h1 class="content-header-bl" style="margin-top: 15px;">Test Plan</h1>
                    <p class="content-body-bl">A test plan is a comprehensive overview of all the activities involved in the testing phase of the software development cycle. It includes the testing scope, scheduling, and resources to provide a high-level perspective for the QA team when conducting their work. </p>
                    <h1 class="content-header-bl" style="margin-top: 15px;">Test Scenario</h1>
                    <p class="content-body-bl">A test scenario clearly outlines the multiple methods of testing the software, which leads to individual test cases being developed. It involves identifying how the user could misuse the system and planning tests for those outcomes.</p>
                    <h1 class="content-header-bl" style="margin-top: 15px;">Test Report</h1>
                    <p class="content-body-bl">A record of the status of each test case that has been run so you can look back on the outcome of each test. The test report gives a broad overview of all the testing activities that have been performed, while a defect report records any feature in the software that fails to work as expected. </p>
                    <h1 class="content-header-bl" style="margin-top: 15px;">Checklist</h1>
                    <p class="content-body-bl">A checklist is an alternative to a test case which provides a list of the software features that the tester needs to analyze, alongside a description of their functionality and the test outcome. </p>
                    <h1 class="content-header-bl" style="margin-top: 15px;">Bug Report</h1>
                    <p class="content-body-bl">One of the primary jobs of a tester is to search for bugs within the software, and a bug report is a log of any bugs identified alongside the process for how to recreate the bug. It includes details of the impact the bug will have on the system and recommendations for prioritizing it.</p>
                    <h1 class="content-header-bl" style="margin-top: 15px;">Requirements</h1>
                    <p class="content-body-bl">Also known as a software requirements specification, the requirement is a full description of the functions and features of the software being built to ensure that all teams, including software, product and testing, are fully informed.</p>

                    <h1 class="content-header-bl" style="margin-top: 15px; font-size: 30px">Best practices for getting best results from documentation for testing</h1>
                    <p class="content-body-bl">Here are some best practices for writing the best test documentation that performs well in practice. </p>
                    <ul class="content-body-bl">
                        <li>●	Use a knowledge base system as a single source of truth – you want your test documentation to be kept all in one place so every team member knows where to find your documents without wasting time searching. Without a single source of truth, team members may lose faith in the documentation or recreate documents needlessly. </li><br>
                        <li>●	Keep your test documentation up-to-date in line with shifting requirements – it hardly needs to state that the requirements of a software product are constantly changing, so you’ll need to keep your documentation in line with these shifts, to reflect the state of the software accurately. </li><br>
                        <li>●	Keep your documentation private to protect sensitive information being leaked – another advantage of using dedicated knowledge base software is that you can keep your documentation private, restricted only to your team. High levels of security are available to ensure that no unauthorized parties have access to your documents. </li><br>
                        <li>●	Educate your team about the importance of test documentation – documentation will only work in your testing team if everyone involved is educated about the importance of documenting your activities. Creating, maintaining, and using documentation are all vital aspects of developing a thriving documentation culture. </li><br>
                        <li>●	Regularly prune your test documentation for relevancy – It get better results when you frequently remove documents that are no longer useful so that your testing team and other stakeholders get the maximum benefit from the documentation. </li><br>
                        <li>●	Only document what is directly related to your testing activities – documentation that is too comprehensive ends up being unwieldy and less than useful to your testers. Only document the core activities of your  testing team to ensure that each document has a purpose. </li><br>
                        <li>●	Avoid treating documenting as a box-checking exercise – when your testing team only documents in order to fulfill requirements, it becomes an uninspiring box-checking exercise that feels like a waste of time. Clearly articulate the business-critical reason for documenting and your team will be more motivated. </li><br>
                        <li>●	Follow a style guide to ensure consistency across documentation  – documentation must be consistent across the company no matter who is writing it, and for that you need a style guide that everyone adheres to. </li><br>
                        <li>●	Make use of version control to track the documentation – opt for a system that keeps track of different versions of your documentation so you always know what changes have been made and by whom. Version control shows how your documentation has changed over time and allows you to revert back if necessary.</li><br>
